# Matt's Dotfiles

## Welcome 2024
I've done this one to may times... so here we go again :)
At this point I figured I'd start keeping a "historic" view -- while there's over a decade of dotfiles. 
This repo will have the recent adventures with updated Neovim and whatever adventure lies next. 

## Uses

In no particular order

- iTerm2 | Windows Termial (WSL)

Overall, I try to keep my setup slim, or at least with minimal "config". 
The more drop 'n play, the better IMO.

# Matt's Dotfiles

## Welcome

About once a year I try to cleanup and reclaim my dotfiles...
Only recently did I begin storing some "what did I used to do..." notes

This repo *should* have the recent adventures along with whatever adventure lies next.

Overall, I try to keep my setup slim, or at least with minimal "config".
LazyVim was "close enough" after a few tweaks -- I try to not over complicate my nvim setup.

The more drop 'n play, the better

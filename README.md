# Matt's Dotfiles

## Welcome

About once a year I try to cleanup and reclaim my dotfiles...

Only recently did I begin storing some "what did I used to do..." notes

This repo _should_ have the recent adventures along with whatever adventure lies next.

Overall, I try to keep my setup slim, or at least the installation of.
The more drop 'n play, the better.

## LazyVim / Nvim

After testing different configs and setups, I landed on a stripped-down version of LazyVim as "close enough".

For my nvim config checkout [lazy-vim repo](https://github.com/mthomps4/lazy-vim)

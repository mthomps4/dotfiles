## My current setup

### Vim
I try to keep a slim `.vimrc`
I've been experimenting with CoC autocomplete and Ale to land on a good combination for TypeScript/JavaScript.

Future:
Thinking I can leverage CoC Language Servers more and nix Ale entirely.
Ale currently has better tooling and helpers to leverage. For now this is a 1. 2. combo approach.

### Bashrc
Standard Ubuntu Setup with some extra helpers for AG SilverSearcher (FZF) and nvmrc help

### Bash Aliases
Rando assortment of things I've found useful before.
Couple of docker purge/prune helpers and navigation
